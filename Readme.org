* My special Emacs config

This is my emacs config. it's practical and written using org-babel to start put ~Emacs.org~ in your ~.emacs.d~ and do ~M-x org-babel-tangle~.

* Motivation

I've been using the amazing doom emacs for a while and even though it covered most of my needs i found my self blocked because i don't know how each part of the framework work together and how to change things in the config.

So i wanted to learn emacs for some time, i've been attracted to how it's actually a very interesting lisp machine and how adding plugins is just the same as builtin code.
